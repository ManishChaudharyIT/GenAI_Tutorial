* A general-purpose model that takes in **plain text** and returns **plain text**.
* It has **no awareness of roles** (user/system/assistant).
* Best used for: generation, summarization, translation, classification, etc.

### **Chat Model**:

* A language model **fine-tuned for multi-turn conversation**.
* Takes in **structured messages** (roles: `user`, `assistant`, `system`).
* Best used for: chatbots, agents, dialogue systems, tools using memory or functions.

---

## 02 ## How to improve result of your chat model
Absolutely! Here's the full explanation of how to **better control your Chat Model using the `temperature` parameter.

---

## 🔥 What is Temperature?

`temperature` is a key parameter that controls the **randomness** or **creativity** of a language model's responses.

* **Lower values (0.0 – 0.3)** → More **deterministic**, focused, and **predictable** output.
* **Higher values (0.7 – 1.5+)** → More **random**, creative, and **diverse** responses.

---

## 🎯 How to Use Temperature to Improve Chat Model Behavior

| **Use Case**                          | **Recommended Temperature** | **Effect on Output**                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Factual answers (math, code, facts)   | `0.0 – 0.3`                 | Precise, confident, and accurate              |
| Balanced response (Q\&A, explanation) | `0.5 – 0.7`                 | Mix of accuracy and flexibility               |
| Creative writing (stories, jokes)     | `0.9 – 1.2`                 | High creativity, imagination, humor           |
| Brainstorming / Wild ideas            | `1.5+`                      | Maximum randomness, great for idea generation |

---

## 🛠️ How to Set Temperature in LangChain

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# For factual responses
chat_fact = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)

# For balanced, general-purpose answers
chat_balanced = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.6)

# For creative writing and storytelling
chat_creative = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=1.0)

# For brainstorming and high divergence
chat_random = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=1.5)
```

---

## 💡 Use Case Examples

### ✅ Example 1: Fact-Based Answer

```python
chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
response = chat.invoke("What is the boiling point of water in Celsius?")
print(response.content)
```

### ✅ Example 2: Creative Poem

```python
chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=1.0)
response = chat.invoke("Write a short poem about a robot who falls in love.")
print(response.content)
```

### ✅ Example 3: Brainstorming Ideas

```python
chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=1.7)
response = chat.invoke("Give me wild startup ideas involving AI and coffee shops.")
print(response.content)
```

---

## ✅ Final Tips for Using Chat Models Effectively

* Use **low temperature** for **precision and reliability**.
* Use **moderate temperature** for **natural language generation and Q\&A**.
* Use **high temperature** for **creative applications or idea generation**.
* Combine `temperature` with **system prompts** to control tone and behavior.

## 03 ## Max Completion Token:-
Great! Let's dive deep into **`max_tokens`** (also sometimes referred to as **`max_completion_tokens`**) — a **critical parameter** 
for using language models like GPT effectively, especially with APIs or libraries like **OpenAI**, **LangChain**, or **HuggingFace**.

---

## 🧠 What is `max_tokens`?

### ✅ Definition:

`max_tokens` defines the **maximum number of tokens** the model is allowed to **generate in its response** (i.e., the completion/output).

It does **NOT** limit the size of your prompt/input — just the length of the response generated **by the model**.

---

## 🔢 What is a "token"?

* Tokens are chunks of text — typically:

  * 1 token ≈ 0.75 words
  * 1 token ≈ 4 characters (on average)

| Phrase                  | Approx. Tokens |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| `"Hello"`               | 1              |
| `"OpenAI rocks!"`       | 3              |
| `"The quick brown fox"` | 5              |

---

## 🔐 Why is `max_tokens` important?

1. **Controls output size** – prevents overly long answers.
2. **Avoids exceeding token limits** – especially important for large models like GPT-4.
3. **Improves performance and cost control** – more tokens = more compute cost.

---

## 🧱 Token Limits per Model

| Model Name                | Max Total Tokens (Prompt + Completion) |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| GPT-3.5 (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) | 16,385 tokens                          |
| GPT-4 (8k context)        | 8,192 tokens                           |
| GPT-4 (32k context)       | 32,768 tokens                          |

> So if your input prompt is 1,000 tokens and you set `max_tokens=3000`, the total would be 4000 — within limits.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use `max_tokens`

### ✅ In LangChain:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

chat = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500  # Response will be capped at 500 tokens
)
response = chat.invoke("Explain quantum computing like I'm 5.")
print(response.content)
```

### ✅ In OpenAI API directly:

```python
import openai

openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain gravity"}],
    max_tokens=200
)
```

---

## 🎯 When to Adjust `max_tokens`?

| Situation                                 | Suggested `max_tokens` |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Short factual Q\&A                        | 50 – 150               |
| General explanations                      | 200 – 500              |
| Essays, blogs, or reports                 | 1000 – 2000+           |
| Creative writing or storytelling          | 500 – 1500             |
| Tool-using agents or multi-turn reasoning | 1000 – 3000            |

---

## ⚠️ What Happens if You Set It Too Low?

* The model may **cut off mid-sentence**.
* Incomplete thoughts or results.
* You may get a `finish_reason = "length"` in the response metadata, which means it ran out of tokens.

---

## ✅ Pro Tip: Combine with `stop` tokens

Use `stop` to define where generation should end — helpful when you want to avoid long or runaway completions **without setting a low `max_tokens`**.

```python
ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", max_tokens=1000, stop=["\nHuman:", "END"])
```

---

## 🧮 Cost Consideration

* You are billed for **both input + output tokens**.
* Controlling `max_tokens` helps you **optimize cost** on platforms like OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.

---

## 📌 Summary

| Parameter     | What It Controls                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `max_tokens`  | Max tokens **in the response**                    |
| `temperature` | Randomness/creativity of the response             |
| `top_p`       | Alternative to temperature (probability sampling) |
| `stop`        | Where to end generation manually                  |

## 006 ## Embeding:-
Embeddings are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling the transformation of complex data into lower-dimensional 
vector spaces that preserve semantic relationships. Here's an in-depth exploration of embedding models, covering key topics:

---

## 1. What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical representations of data—such as words, images, or users—mapped into a continuous vector space.
 This transformation allows machine learning models to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently by capturing semantic or contextual similarities between data points. ([Wikipedia][1], [Couchbase][2])

---

## 2. Types of Embeddings

### a. **Word Embeddings**

Represent words in a vector space, capturing semantic relationships. Examples include:

* **Word2Vec**: Uses neural networks to learn word associations.
* **GloVe**: Combines global word co-occurrence statistics.
* **fastText**: Considers subword information for better handling of rare words.

### b. **Sentence and Document Embeddings**

Extend word embeddings to larger text units. Examples:

* **Doc2Vec**: Generates document-level embeddings.
* **Sentence-BERT**: Applies BERT for sentence-level embeddings.([Wikipedia][3])

### c. **Image Embeddings**

Map images into vector spaces using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling tasks like image retrieval and classification.([Kolena][4])

### d. **Graph Embeddings**

Represent nodes, edges, or entire graphs in vector spaces, preserving structural information.

### e. **Multimodal Embeddings**

Integrate multiple data types (e.g., text and images) into a unified embedding space, facilitating tasks like image captioning.

---

## 3. Popular Embedding Models

* **Recommendation Systems**: Personalized content suggestions based on user-item embeddings.
* **Information Retrieval**: Enhancing search engines with semantic understanding.
* **Healthcare**: Analyzing patient records and medical images.([Wikipedia][6])

---

## 5. Embedding Techniques

* **Neural Networks**: Learn embeddings through supervised or unsupervised training.
* **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposes large matrices (e.g., user-item interactions) into latent factors.
* **Autoencoders**: Compress data into lower-dimensional embeddings and reconstruct inputs.([Medium][7])

---

## 6. Evaluation of Embeddings

* **Intrinsic Evaluation**: Measures embedding quality using tasks like word similarity.
* **Extrinsic Evaluation**: Assesses embeddings based on performance in downstream tasks.

---

## 7. Challenges and Considerations

* **Bias in Embeddings**: Pre-trained embeddings may capture societal biases present in training data.

Embeddings are integral to numerous machine learning applications, providing a means to represent complex data in a 
form amenable to analysis and prediction. Understanding their types, applications, and challenges is essential for leveraging their full potential in various domains.

Example:- How to use Embedding  for documents

from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "Python is a high-level programming language.",
    "Paris is the capital of France.",
    "The moon orbits the Earth.",
    "Football is a popular sport."
]

# Step 1: Create embeddings
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Step 2: Create FAISS vector store
faiss_index = FAISS.from_texts(documents, embedding=embedding_model)

# Step 3: Get user query
query = input("Enter your question: ")

# Step 4: Retrieve relevant documents
retriever = faiss_index.as_retriever()
relevant_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)

# Step 5: Build prompt from relevant content
context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])
prompt = f"""Use the following context to answer the question.

Context:
{context}

Question: {query}
"""

# Step 6: Use LLM (you can plug in HuggingFace or OpenAI)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)

# Step 7: Invoke the model
response = llm.invoke([HumanMessage(content=prompt)])

print("Answer:", response.content)



## 07 ## All About Prompts:-
Great! Let’s break down everything you asked in a clear and structured way. This will cover the 
**foundations of prompting**, types of prompts, professional practices, and how to use prompts effectively with **LLMs (like GPT)**.
---

## 🧠 What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is any input you send to an LLM (Large Language Model) to get a response. It can be a question, instruction, task, or context.

### Example:

```text
"Summarize this article: Climate change is affecting global food security..."
```

---

## 🔤 Types of Prompts

### 1. **Textual Prompt**

* Pure text input (most common).
* The input is just natural language.

✅ Example:

```text
"Translate this to French: Hello, how are you?"
```

### 2. **Multimodal Prompt**

* Combines **text + image/audio/video**.
* Used with **multimodal LLMs** like GPT-4 Turbo with Vision.

✅ Example:

> (Image of a graph)
> Prompt: "Explain what this graph says about global warming."

---

## 📌 Static vs Dynamic Prompts

### 🔹 Static Prompt

* Hardcoded, fixed text.
* Does not change based on context or input.

✅ Example:

```python
prompt = "Summarize the following text: Climate change is real and urgent..."
```

### 🔹 Dynamic Prompt

* Uses variables or user input to generate the prompt.
* Often built using `.format()` or templates.

✅ Example:

```python
template = "Summarize the following topic: {topic}"
prompt = template.format(topic="Artificial Intelligence")
```

---

## 🧰 Why Use Template-Based Prompts?

Using templates (like in a dictionary or external file) is better than just `.format()` in-line:

### ✅ Benefits:

* Reusability: One template, many inputs.
* Organization: Easier to manage in large apps.
* Clean code: Business logic stays separate from prompt logic.
* Scalability: You can load prompts from a database, YAML, or JSON.

---

## 💼 How Professionals Use Prompts

1. **Prompt Libraries or Template Managers**

   * Store prompts in separate `.py`, `.json`, or `.yaml` files.
   * Example libraries: LangChain PromptTemplate, Guidance, PromptLayer.

2. **Prompt Engineering Best Practices**

   * Be clear and specific.
   * Use few-shot examples if needed.
   * Include instructions like “respond in bullet points”.

3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

   * Ask the model to "think step-by-step".
   * Improves reasoning tasks.

4. **Tool + Prompt Combo**

   * LLMs integrated with tools (e.g., web search, code execution).
   * Prompt provides instructions; tool provides capabilities.

---

## 🔗 Prompting with LLMs (LangChain / OpenAI)

You often use prompts in conjunction with:

* `ChatOpenAI()` from LangChain
* `PromptTemplate` class
* Prompt + Memory + Chains

✅ Example with LangChain:

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize: {text}")
prompt = template.format(text="AI is changing the world...")

response = model.invoke(prompt)
```

| Concept                   | Description                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Few-shot prompting**    | Provide examples in prompt.                          |
| **Zero-shot prompting**   | Give only the task, no examples.                     |
| **System vs user prompt** | System prompt sets behavior, user prompt gives task. |
| **Prompt Chaining**       | Use one prompt’s output as input for another.        |
| **Evaluation**            | Testing prompt quality systematically.               |
| **Guardrails**            | Adding constraints to model responses.               |

##08## Messages:-
Perfect — let’s dive into the **message types** used in Large Language Model (LLM) APIs like **OpenAI’s Chat API** and frameworks
 like **LangChain**.

Understanding these message roles is key to controlling how an AI model behaves in a **chat-like context**.

---

## 💬 What Are Messages in LLMs?

Messages are the building blocks of a conversation with an LLM. Each message has:

* a **role** (who is speaking)
* and **content** (what they say)

They are passed as a **list** to the LLM to simulate dialogue and context.

---

## 🧱 Core Message Types

### 1. **system**

> 🧠 *“Set the behavior or personality of the AI”*

* Used to define rules, tone, format, or restrictions for the assistant.
* Not shown to users in UI (typically internal).

✅ Example:

```json
{ "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant who replies in markdown." }
```

---

### 2. **user**

> 👤 *“Message from the human/user”*

* The actual task, question, or prompt from the user.
* Can be short or complex.

✅ Example:

```json
{ "role": "user", "content": "Summarize the article on AI regulation." }
```

---

### 3. **assistant (or ai in LangChain)**

> 🤖 *“The model's response”*

* What the LLM replies with.
* Stored to maintain history or chain reasoning.

✅ Example:

```json
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a summary of the article..." }
```

---

## 🧪 Additional Message Types (Advanced / Framework-Specific)

### 4. **tool (OpenAI + LangChain)**

> 🛠️ *Model calls a tool function (e.g., calculator, search)*

* Used when an AI uses an external tool.
* Content contains the tool’s **name and input**.

✅ Example:

```json
{ "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "xyz", "content": "search('weather in Tokyo')" }
```

### 5. **function\_call (legacy, replaced by tools)**

> 🧮 *Earlier way of doing tool use (still supported)*

* Similar to tool calls, now part of `tool_calls`.

---

## 🧠 Why Different Message Roles Matter

| Role        | Purpose                                 | Required? |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `system`    | Set context, rules, behavior            | Optional  |
| `user`      | Provide prompts, questions              | ✅ Yes     |
| `assistant` | Track previous responses from the model | Optional  |
| `tool`      | Trigger a tool/agent behavior           | Optional  |

**Without role separation**, models can’t reason about who said what — especially in long chats.

---

## 🧰 Example: Full Chat History in OpenAI Format

````python
[
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a coding assistant."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python function to reverse a string."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here's the code:\n```python\ndef reverse(s): return s[::-1]```"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Now explain it line by line."}
]
````

---

## 🌐 How This Is Used in LangChain

LangChain uses:

* `SystemMessage(content="...")`
* `HumanMessage(content="...")`
* `AIMessage(content="...")`

Or via chat models like:

```python
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage

chat = ChatOpenAI()

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a poetic assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="Write a poem about the ocean.")
]

response = chat.invoke(messages)
```

---

## 🧩 Key Use Cases

| Use Case             | Recommended Role Setup                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Chat assistant       | system + user + assistant                          |
| Tool calling (agent) | system + user + assistant + tool                   |
| Persona simulation   | system sets identity (e.g., “You are Elon Musk”)   |
| Context retention    | Use all roles to simulate full conversation memory |
